# Ideas

## Compiling
Cook your recopies (".rcp" files) with the following command:
```bash
chef cook <file>
```
This will copy the blueprint to your clipboard, and show a rough sketch of the layout in the terminal.

## Variables
Variables are immutable by default. This allows for them to be encoded into combinators.

The `mut` keyword allows mutability by compiling to a memory cell.

## Input/Output
Defined areas where combinators are allowed to be placed.

Add combinators to preexisting blueprints.

## Mod Support
The ability to import mods, and use the added items in blueprints

## Fun
Random greeting after successful compilation.

Tells you useful cooking tips when compilation fails.
