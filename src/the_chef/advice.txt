Are you following a recipe?
Have you sharpened your knives recently? That may help!
Maybe add some garlic powder?
I think it needs more salt.
You could always just order something...
It needs a little spice.
Not quite done.
Overcooked.
Uff.
Are you sure these are the right proportions?
Measure twice, mix once.
Have you remembered to preheat the oven?
...is that how its supposed to look?
Experimentation is good!
If you mix cream too long, it'll turn into butter!
A good cook knows their spices!
That is... unique.
